  Week 3 - Recap
</h1>

## Get ready for next week

Next week, we'll be delving into NodeJS, which allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser - exciting!

To make sure you're ready to go for this, [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download and install the LTS (long-term support) version of Node for your operating system and install it.

## Mindset - from Joseph

Hello all,

I hope you've had a great week!

We know that School of Code is an accelerated learning experience, it's designed that way because we know people are capable of achieving great things. It's a big ask at times and we recognise that as part of the journey it's important to build up your personal resilience. In this week's module we'll look at personal resilience, how we can manage that voice of doubt that can creep into our minds so we can rise to the challenges we want to take on.

[The video is here](https://vimeo.com/652602854/1a7afa815c), and there's also a few [resilience models](./Resilience%20Models.pdf) for you to look at as part of the module (no template this week as you'll be creating your own version of the resilience checklist and it's best if you use a format that works for you).
