  Week 3 - Recap
</h1>

## Get ready for next week

Next week, we'll be delving into NodeJS, which allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser - exciting!

To make sure you're ready to go for this, [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download and install the LTS (long-term support) version of Node for your operating system and install it.

## Mindset - from Joseph

Hello all,

I hope you've had a great week!

We know that School of Code is an accelerated learning experience, it's designed that way because we know people are capable of achieving great things. It's a big ask at times and we recognise that as part of the journey it's important to build up your personal resilience. In this week's module we'll look at personal resilience, how we can manage that voice of doubt that can creep into our minds so we can rise to the challenges we want to take on.

[The video is here](https://vimeo.com/652602854/1a7afa815c), and there are also a few [resilience models](./Resilience%20Models.pdf) for you to look at as part of the module (no template this week as you'll be creating your own version of the resilience checklist and it's best if you use a format that works for you).

## Recap tasks

### Task 1

TBC - IDEA HERE

Follow the Design Thinking Process and UX/UI planning we've covered this week. Be sure to document (notes, screenshots, etc.) each stage of your planning in this repository before you build, including:

- Create user personas and user stories - who will be using your app? What needs will this app fulfill?
- Plan your design, and create your wireframes.
- Create a flow diagram that documents the journey of your user as they use your app.

Then use HTML and CSS to turn your wireframes into an application like we did earlier in the week.

- Use CSS variables with your color scheme.
- Implement flexbox or grid for positioning.
- Pay attention to how you're naming and organizing your CSS - is your CSS readable? Are your classnames based on purpose rather than values like colors that may change?
- Think about accessibility. Do your images have alt tags? Have you checked how your color scheme looks to someone who's color-blind? Run a Lighthouse audit and check out the accessibility report.

🌟 Bonus: If you're happy with your design and you have time to spare, start to add functionality to your page using your DOM manipulation skills in JavaScript (you can use array methods, add inputs, buttons, etc. with event listeners, and more).

## Task 2

At this point in the course, we've covered the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. W3Schools has quizzes on each, so we'd like you to give them a go.

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_quiz.asp)
- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_quiz.asp)

Complete the quizzes, and [click here](https://forms.gle/rMpCPpZWGzRBhkB98) to record your scores.
